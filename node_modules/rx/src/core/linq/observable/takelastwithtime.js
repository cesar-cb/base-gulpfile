    /**
     *  Returns elements within the specified duration from the end of the observable source sequence, using the specified schedulers to run timers and to drain the collected elements.
     *  
     * @example
     *  1 - res = source.takeLastWithTime(5000, [optional timer scheduler], [optional loop scheduler]); 
     * @description
     *  This operator accumulates a queue with a length enough to store elements received during the initial duration window.
     *  As more elements are received, elements older than the specified duration are taken from the queue and produced on the
     *  result sequence. This causes elements to be delayed with duration.    
     * @param {Number} duration Duration for taking elements from the end of the sequence.
     * @param {Scheduler} [timerScheduler]  Scheduler to run the timer on. If not specified, defaults to Rx.Scheduler.timeout.
     * @param {Scheduler} [loopScheduler]  Scheduler to drain the collected elements. If not specified, defaults to Rx.Scheduler.immediate.
     * @returns {Observable} An observable sequence with the elements taken during the specified duration from the end of the source sequence.
